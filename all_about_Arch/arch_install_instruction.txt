1. create a bootable arch linux container.
2. after boot select the container for access.
3. check ping. (short terms internet Connection)
4. run command: "timedatectl set-ntp true".
5. check if the time date is correct or not by running, run command: "timedatectl status".
6. if your hard disk (where you are going to install arch linux) contains another OS image or
    has a different label. then most likely you need to wipe all the parition in that hard disk
7. run command: "lsblk" (list block).
8. there you will see your hard disk and its partition (tree format) (like sda1, sda2 or sdb1 or sdb 2)
9. in my case my desired hard disk is "sda" so from now on I will use "sda" for my particular hard disk name.
10. run command: "wipefs -a /dev/sda".
11. then run command: "fdisk" or "cfdisk". (I will prefer cfdisk over fdisk you will surely know why)
12. In Gnu/Linux there are 3 types of partition people create often. These are Boot partition(boot), Root partition(root)
    and Swap partition(swap).
13. boot : boot partition is for boot space. Surely there are some benefit creating this partition. 
    root : root partition is where your OSs system file will be. very important.
    swap : swap partition is like RAM(random access memory). Early age people doesn't have enough ram so they would create
            a swap partition for get rid of ram overflowing issues.
14. we are only going to create only two partition. root and swap.
15. run "cfdisk" and create your partition. first create root partition give it space. and make it bootable.
16. after that make swap partition and make it size(1GB to 2 GB max)
     and change its type from "83 linux" to "82 swap solaris bla bla bla"  
17. after doing that you will get 2 partition. boot partition and swap partition.
    in my case "sda1" is my root partition and "sda2" is my swap partition.
    confirm it by running "lsblk". you will see.
18. format your boot partion to "ext4" file system.
19. run command: "mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1"
20. don't run above for swap partition. I repeat don't
21. for swap run command: "mkswap /dev/sda2"
22. run command: "swapon /dev/sda2"
23. mount your root partition to "/mnt". run command: "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt"
24. then run command: "pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware vim" (if you don't know how to operate "vim" then 
    write "nano"). these are just text editors.
25. give it some time. then generate fstab with "UID".
26. run command: "genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab".
27. after generating fstab. run command: "arch-chroot /mnt".
28. set time zone. run command: "ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Dhaka /etc/localtime".
29. run command: "hwclock --systohc".
30. genearate a locale file. run command: "locale-gen"
31. run command: "vim /etc/locale.conf". (configure locale.conf file with vim)
32. If you are new to "vim" text editor then this is for you otherwise skip this line. after opening vim press 'i' for insert mode then insert 
    your desired text. then press 'Esc'. press ':' and 'w' 'q' to save. if you don't like "vim" then use "nano".
33. in "vim" or "nano" write: "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" and save it quit it.
34. run command: "vim /etc/hostname"
35. give a name to your device for time being I am using "ArchLinux". save and quit.
36. run command: "vim /etc/hosts"
37. write:
        
    127.0.01    localhost
    ::1         localhost
    127.0.1.1   ArchLinux.localdomain ArchLinux

    save and quit.
38. set your root password. run command: "passwd".
39. set your user name and password. run command: "useradd -m 'any_name'". I am giving my name 'lian'. name must be in small case.
40. 'sudo' is not installed so run command: "pacman -S sudo" to install it.
41. run command: "usermod -aG wheel,audio,video,optical,storage lian".
42. to check your user group run command: "groups lian".
43. run command: "visudo".
44. detect line containing this "## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command".
    after that line there will be another line contains "# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL".
    just remove that '#' hash or number sign from the starting of the line.
    save and quit.
45. run command: "systemctl enable dhcpcd".
46. if the command return anything unusal than just install dhcpcd by running, run command: "pacman -S dhcpcd".
    then run the line 45 command again.
47. install a bootloader. I will prefer 'grub'. install 'grub', run command: "pacman -S grub".
48. run command: "grub-install /mnt/sda". don't give any number after 'sda'. be careful.
49. generate grub config file. this is very important. 
    run command: "grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg".
50. then simply just reboot the computer and remove the container or pendrive.
    run command: "reboot now".
    
****** you may face some problem after installing any desktop environment. the problem will be like "unable to open terminal".
        that time just fix the 'local-gen' file.
****** alt+ctrl+F2 in the login screen will take you to the 'tty' or command screen. 
        alt+ctrl+F1 will take you back to GUI or login screen.
